# Phonosynthesis
> Where roots meet roots.
[Demonstration](https://youtu.be/I5uxJP_UHfg)

## Description

The word "Phonosynthesis" is a fusion between "photosynthesis" and "phonograph" and is meant to hint at the concept behind this application: it is an archive of music that was either composed for plants or heavily inspired by plants. Users have the ability to add or remove records by their title, artwork and name. The submissions will take the form of cards on the homepage. A song titled "Rhubarb" plays in the background.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Setup and Activation

After cloning the repository, run the following commands in two separate terminal windows to initialize this application:

```
 $ npx json-server db.json
 $ npx lite-server
 ```
The application should then open itself up on your browser.

## Inspiration

Plants and music are two of the most loved domains in the entire world, yet a functional archive which contains the music inspired by plants does not exist. I am a huge fan of music for plants, it brings a tremendous amount of joy into my world and so I wanted to create something which had the potential to share that joy with others. The design element was inspired by many of the sites around the early dot com boom. I am attracted to their rawness.
